## A Common Problem

There's a class of use cases that share similar requirements despite looking quite different at first glance:

* A chat room linearizes and displays concurrent messages between tens of thousands of users.
* A gameserver computes an authoritative state from the inputs of players and the internal logic of its world.
* A collaborative graphics editor syncs high-frequency changes to the positions, colors, etc. of its shapes.

In all cases:

1. **Low-latency** for users anywhere in the world is essential to a compelling user experience, implying a deployment across tens of regions. 
2. **Performant and scalable** compute is needed to process a high volume of concurrent inputs.
3. The service requires **strong consistency** to resolve inputs into a single source of truth before displaying it back to users.

Historically, these requirements have often resulted in difficult tradeoffs: _global, performant, strongly consistent -- pick 2_.

A potential approach could be to build such a service on top of a CDN's edge offerings. Maybe something like [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) for globally distributed compute, connections over [WebSockets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/websockets/) for real-time low-latency communications, and updating [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/using-durable-objects) to sync state across parallel executions. In fact, the [release announcement](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-workers-durable-objects/) for durable objects specifically calls similar use cases as their intended target.

Still, for an average engineer such as yours truly, this isn't exactly a walk in the park. We have to learn the specific APIs and idiosyncrasies of a given vendor. We can't easily test our code locally because a lot of the complexity comes from the interplay of various serverless offerings. We're strongly nudged towards the javascript / typescript / Wasm ecosystem rather than our runtime or framework of choice.

On paper, the release of [Fly Machines](https://fly.io/blog/fly-machines/) provides an interesting alternative:

* [Firecracker microVMs](https://fly.io/blog/sandboxing-and-workload-isolation/) provide great workload isolation, quick boot times, and performant compute.
* [Fly Machines](https://fly.io/docs/reference/machines/) offer an API to manually orchestrate VMs and the ability to scale down to zero.
* The [WireGuard-backed Anycast network](https://fly.io/blog/ipv6-wireguard-peering/) connect all instances across regions on a mesh VLAN.
* The [Fly-Replay Header](https://fly.io/docs/reference/fly-replay/) dynamically configures Fly's built-in proxy to route network requests.

This all seems a bit too good to be true, so **this project explores how well these claims hold in practice, and where sharp edges remain**.

### Building a demo app

![demo](./docs/assets/20220921_demo_1.gif)

Our solution has two parts: 

* A `lobby` that lists available gameservers in various regions and lets users join them. 
* A `gameserver` that accepts connections from many concurrent users. Each `gameserver` is in its own region, and only users connected to the same `gameserver` can chat together.

The `gameserver` serializes and synchronizes everyone's inputs and displays the resulting authoritative state back to users in real-time. We share the same codebase for the `lobby` and `webserver` and deploy it as a regular Fly App to n regions. Here, we've deployed to EWR (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸), NRT (ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ), and CDG (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·). 

![regions](./docs/assets/20220921_drawing_1.png)

We could route traffic to individual instances, but to keep the demo simple, we're deploying 1 instance per region, and routing traffic per region. If we wanted to route traffic to individual instances, we'd need the instance ids to be static, which would also require deploying them as Fly Machines rather than a managed App.

We run the [`Phoenix`](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix) web server because LiveViews (real-time server-rendered pages) let us minimize the amount of code we write for the frontend and PubSub mechanism, to focus on the interesting bits. The `lobby` is a LiveView that lives at `/`. The `gameserver` is a LiveView running at `/gameserver/<region>`. An individual instance doesn't keep track of which other instances are running, only that the app is deployed in 3 specific regions. The little flag shown in the navigation bar visually confirms where a request is served from based on the `FLY_REGION` env variable that each instance has access to.

![liveview](./docs/assets/20220921_drawing_2.png)

When a user loads a LiveView, in practice it first GETs a static version of the HTML, then it establishes a websocket to open a stateful bidirectional connection that allows fast server-side rendering and dynamic updates. Rather than relying on traditional forms, we tap the websocket to post new messages, change the username, and refresh all messages in real time. We even piggyback on the websocket to subscribe to a shared PubSub topic called `gameserver:<region>`; each user broadcasts their own messages to the topic and receives everyone's messages in return. Phoenix and LiveView buy us quite a bit here: no SPA, no kafka, no refresh mechanism, etc.

### Routing requests - the goal

**TODO** how Fly's proxy works, what a websocket is established (just HTTP calls), and the Fly Replay Header

### Routing requests - within Phoenix

Phoenix and its ecosystem rely on a library called `Plug` to model and modify connections. 

When a user joins a gameserver from the lobby, they attempt to `GET` the page at `/gameserver/<instance>` and the lobby automatically inserts the "Fly-Replay Header" to seamlessly redirect the connection to that specific instance. ~~We rely on the [`Plug`](https://github.com/elixir-plug/plug) library for consistently adding the header on calls to the `/gameserver/` route.~~ update: This approach works for regular HTTP calls, but not the websocket mount macro unfortunately. See details in the [elixir forums](https://elixirforum.com/t/how-to-intercept-http-messages-generated-by-endpoints-socket-macro-with-a-plug/50377).

**TODO** Insert a "sequence diagram" showing the user first `GET`ting a regular static page, upgrading to a websocket-powered LiveView, then opening a second WebSocket to connect to a bidirectional Channel to share messages with all users.

Besides loading the page itself, all users connected to a given gameserver open a WebSocket to a [Channel](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html) (the default PubSub mechanism in Phoenix). The Channel lets each user posts their messages as well as receive updates from everyone else in return. update: we ended up using the channel that's built into the LiveView (see subscribe and broadcast calls) rather than adding a new one.

### Routing requests - with Caddy as reverse proxy

See this [other repo](https://github.com/mtremsal/fly-replay-header-caddy) for an alternative approach using Caddy as a reverse proxy in front of the demo app.

**TODO** Explain how Caddy is setup, how that works well for hardcoded destinations, but how we're missing the "target region" information the HTTP call that starts the websocket hanshake.

### Routing requests - with Caddy as reverse proxy and websocket params in Phoenix

![churchill](./docs/assets/darkest-hour-darkest-hour-gifs.gif)

**TODO** Explain the plan to inject params in the socket or use subdomains to track which region the `/live/websocket` calls are meant to reach.

## Findings and Sharp Edges

**TODO** Summarize learnings, both the benefits of the approach, and the sharp edges to keep in mind when architecting for it.

* Getting all users on a single shared VM buys us low-latency and high-volume updates, without having to rely on a quirky serverless storage service.
* Working with full VMs at the edge provides a lot of flexibility in terms of architecture, such as letting us run whatever runtime and library we're familiar with. 
* ~~We were able to test our code locally and iterate quickly, without having to push it to several serverless APIs each time.~~ update: except for the networking part, which is unique de Fly
* ~~Relying on the Fly-Replay Header removed the need to run our own proxy or a service mesh, though to be fair, that's also not needed with serverless offerings.~~
* Compared to a traditional public cloud provider, we didn't have to punch holes through firewalls and security groups to get isolated regions to talk to each other. 

While we didn't run into them, let's keep in mind the limitations listed in the announcement post for [Fly Machines](https://fly.io/blog/fly-machines/#how-fly-machines-will-frustrate-you-the-emotional-cost-of-simplicity), most notably that stopped machines aren't guaranteed to be available again and aren't fully free.

## What's Next?

### Higher Throughput

The demo currently showcases a simple chat for the real-time collaboration use case. In particular, the chat use case is stateless: while there's a shared Channel for all connected users, each LiveView is in charge of displaying new messages that it receives. A quick improvement would be to have a stateful server that caches the last 100 messages received from the Channel so that new users can catch up on the conversation. A more involved upgrade would be to switch to a real-time graphics editor or a multiplayer mini-game that would synchronize hundreds of updates per second for each user.

### Network Isolation

While Machines are private by default, the demo still operates lobbies and gameservers on the same default network shared by the entire Fly organization. This is very convenient, but for a production scenario we'd likely isolate gameservers in their own private network. The guide to [build a Function-as-a-Service platform](https://fly.io/docs/app-guides/functions-with-machines/) touches on this point.

### VM Orchestration

The demo doesn't currently demonstrate how Machines scale to zero and boot fast. In fact, everything that we're currently doing could be achieved with a regular Fly app, without manually provisioning low-level Machines. A simple improvement would be to shut down empty gameservers (without any active websocket connection) after a few seconds. The lobby would list available regions (1 machine per region) rather than instance ids. It would start a gameserver before the first user joins it and cache its instance id locally. Note that the lobby remains stateless: if we attempt to start an already running gameserver, we can just ignore the error, cache its instance id, and move on.
